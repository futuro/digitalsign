digital-signage
===============

A Puppet module configuring and managing a digital signage platform. This will auto-login via
lightdm with a preset user, starting StumpWM which then starts Conkeror with a particular url. The
aim of this module is to simply have a browser and window manager that have no decorations around
them, allowing you to display any web page kiosk style.
